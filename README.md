Flow Trace Plugin for Qgis This Plugin will select all upstream polyline segments starting from a selected line segment. The only data you need to supply is a layer with polyline segments and a selected feature from the layer. If no segments are selected then you have connectivity issues with your data.  It will select the upstream node based on the digitized direction.
